# Self-Driving-Logic-Simulator
This is a simulation of how a self-driving technology can use lasers to measure distances to nearby cars and make safe maneuvers. 

Functionality includes:
- (Safe) Lane Changing
- (Changable) Car following distance
- Highway driving simulation![460a303649a08d2f736f5492fab560a2](https://github.com/neomorrison/Self-Driving-Logic-Simulator/assets/44535532/761435d7-5ba1-4149-81e9-f41332c41b30)
